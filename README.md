# Pewlett Hackard Employee analysis



## Background
- I was asked to lead a project looking at the people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 
  All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.;
- I was aked by HR to provide the following analyses and tables:
  1. A list with the employee number, last and first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
  2. A list the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
  3. A list of the managers of each department along with their department number, department name, 
      employee number, last name and first name.
4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, 9rst name, and department name.
5. List the 9rst name, last name, and sex of each employee whose 9rst name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
`. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and 9rst name.
7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, 9rst name, and department name.
b. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

Data Analysis


## Approach

- I studies the CSV files to determine to determine how I would need to construct the database, including relationships between the files, the types and sizes of the data, and any inconsitencies such as empty fields and possible unclear entries.
- I then created an ERD diagram to assist me in creating the various tables and constraints for the database. The ERD can be found in [ERD Pewlett Hackard.pdf](https://github.com/Reinierandrew/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/ERD%20Pewlett%20Hackard.pdf) and below.
- The sql file for creating the table schema can be found in [table_schema.mssql](https://github.com/Reinierandrew/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/table_schema.mssql)
- I then used the results to create a file with the schema to load to a ERD package to generate the final ERD [ERD Pewlett Hackard.pdf](https://github.com/Reinierandrew/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/ERD%20Pewlett%20Hackard.pdf)
- I loaded the CSV files which can be found in the data directory and wrote the script to analyse the data and create the 8 tables the HR department has requested.
-  The sql file for the data analysis can be found in [data_analysis.mssql](https://github.com/Reinierandrew/sql-challenge/tree/main/EmployeeSQL)
